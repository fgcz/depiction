## Status
A lot of the files and folders are in a early development state or may require some serious refactoring.
For now, I give a summary of the modules which are somewhat stable already:



## Setup dev environment
```bash
uv venv # <- if not using anaconda
uv pip install -e ".[dev,testing]"
```
